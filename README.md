# WeatherAR?

## What is WeatherAR?

WeatherAR is a mobile application that uses React Native and AR technology to display weather information in real-time. The app will allow users to view weather conditions in their current location through the camera view on their mobile device. The app will use 3D modals to display information about the weather, including temperature, precipitation, humidity, wind speed, and direction.

### Wireframes

Below is the proposed wireframes made during the design session of the Ship In 30 event. This is used as a guide although flows and designs maybe change as the project matures

## Tech Stack

React Native, Expo, Expo-Three-AR

To run, you will need to install the Expo app on your mobile device and scan the QR code generated by the Expo CLI.

After installing the node packages using npm. You can run npx expo start to start the application.

## Contributing

WhichStack? uses a 3 legged branching strategy with "Main" being the production version of the code; Main just reflects the current version that is live to the public. The "Development" branch contains the active changes and made by the engineers to implement new features or fixes; pull requests are needed to contribute into "Development" with 2 approvals from engineers.

When you are contributing to WhichStack? you will need to create a new branch based off of the "Development" branch. Please format the branch with a prefix and a name that best describes the type of change being implemented these contain:

- `feature/`(New feature branches)
- `fix/` (Fixes for branches)
- `task/`(Generic branches for mundane tasks, such as updating a lang file or dependencies)

Once you have selected the branch type please create a branch name as a suffix. For example, if you had a branch that implemented a login button on the home page you would call it `feature/home-page-login-button`

Upon completing your changes **that are tested** please raise a pull request that is merging **into development**, fill out the template and drop a link to the pull request in the "Ship In 30" discussion channel (https://discord.com/channels/368853404723707914/1073307477405335592). Upon review and approval your changes will be submitted into the development branch. Then once the version is ready, it is released into production.
